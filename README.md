Overview

Welcome to my submission for Task 03 of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I developed a Simple Contact Management System that allows users to store, manage, and maintain contact information efficiently.

Task Description
Task 03: Implement a Simple Contact Management System

The objective of this task is to build a program that enables users to:

Add new contacts by entering name, phone number, and email address

View the list of saved contacts

Edit existing contact details

Delete contacts when needed

Store contact data in memory or in a file for persistent storage

📇 Features

Add new contacts

View all saved contacts

Edit contact information

Delete contacts

Simple and user-friendly menu-driven interface

Data storage using memory or file system

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

Programming Concepts Applied

Lists / Dictionaries

Conditional statements

Loops

Functions

File handling (for persistent storage)

User input validation

🔍 Program Workflow
1️⃣ Add Contact
